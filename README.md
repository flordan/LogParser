# Log Parser

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development
of applications for distributed infrastructures, such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds.
COMP Superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism
of applications at execution time.

This project aims to gather a set of tools to analyze the logs generated by the
COMPSs runtime when running an application.

## Sources Structure

  * **core**: Contains the classes composing the core of the project. This classes are
   totally agnostic of which files are being analysed.
  * **blocked** : Sample application that analyses potential points where an application
  can freeze (tasks and data accesses from the main code) by checking the runtime.log
